function [F, F2] = int_graph_fun(f, arc_from, arc_to, node_fn, graph, bfs_parent_node, bfs_topo_order, bfs_missing_arc)
%INT_GRAPH_FUN  Integrate a multivalued function with branches on a graph.
%
%
% F = int_graph_fun(f, arc_from, arc_to, node_fn)
% integrates the multivalued function f having a single-valued branch for
% each arc of the graph. The graph has an arc a incident to two nodes,
% arc_from(a) and arc_to(a); node n is associated with a value node_fn(n).
% The single-valued branch of f on arc a is defined by f(:,a), and may be
% evaluated at x in the domain of f(:,a) by pvaln(f(:,a), x). The same
% applies to F. Given a node n, F is such that pvaln(F(:,a),x) is the same
% for all arcs a incident to node n. That is, the branches of F, associated
% with arcs incident to a common node, meet continuously at the values
% associated with the common node.
%
% ... = int_graph_fun(f, arc_from, arc_to, node_fn, graph, bfs_parent_node, bfs_topo_order, bfs_missing_arc)
% provides further information about the cycles in the graph, as output
% from cycle_analy_bfs.
%
% [F, F2] = int_graph_fun(...)
% also gives F2, an alternative integral of f where arcs defining cycles in
% the cycle basis of the graph (namely the arcs bfs_missing_arc), are
% integrated in the opposite direction to how F integrated thme. Whereas F
% meets continuously at the "lower" node associated with these arcs, F2
% meets continuously at the "upper" node associated with these arcs. In
% fact, only the branches of F at these arcs bfs_missing_arc are provided
% in F2.
%
%
% --- Input:
% f [P+2, A]: the multivalued function. Each column defines a single-valued
% branch as a polynomial of order P that may be evaluated by pvaln
% arc_from [A, 1]: the "lower" node that each arc is incident to
% arc_to   [A, 1]: the "higher" node that each arc is incident to
% node_fn  [N, 1]: the value associated with each node
% graph [N, N]: sparse matrix representing the graph without duplicate arcs
% bfs_parent_node [N, 1]: the node from which this node was discovered in the breadth-first search
% bfs_topo_order [N, 1]: topological ordering of the nodes in the breadth-first search
% bfs_missing_arc [C, 1]: arcs that were not traversed during the breadth-first search
%
%
% --- Output
% F  [P+3,A]: the integral of f. 
% F2 [P+3,C]: an alternative integral of f for the branches associated with
%             the arcs bfs_missing_arc.
%
% Note, above A is the number of arcs, N the number of nodes, and C the
% number of cycles in the cycle basis of the graph.
