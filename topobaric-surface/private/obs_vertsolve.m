function [p, s, t] = obs_vertsolve(Sppc, Tppc, P, BotK, s, t, p, dfnb, dfnc, s0, t0, tolp) %#codegen
%OBS_VERTSOLVE  Root finding of pressure or depth that matches equation of
%               state with single-valued function.
%
%
% [p, s, t] = obs_vertsolve(Sppc, Tppc, P, BotK, s, t, p, branch, vafnp, s0, t0, tolp)
% finds the pressure or depth p (within tolerance tolp) and its associated
% practical / Absolute salinity s and potential / Conservative temperature
% t, of a surface on which delta equals that determined by the
% single-valued function determined by dfnb (spline break points) and dfnc
% (spline coefficients), in an ocean whose practical / Absolute salinity
% and potential / Conservative temperature as functions of pressure or
% depth P are given by piecewise polynomials whose coefficients are Sppc
% and Tppc, and whose knots are P.  The number of valid data points in each
% water column is given by BotK.  The equation of state is given by eos.m
% in the path, taking S, T, and P as its 3 inputs. delta is the in-situ
% density anomaly or specific volume anomaly, defined as eos(s,t,p) -
% eos(s0,t0,p) where s,t are S,T interpolated from P to p, and s0, t0 are
% reference values.  The inputs s and t are not used, but provided so these
% variables may be manipulated in-place.
%
%
% --- Input:
% Sppc [O, K-1, N]: coefficients for piecewise polynomial for practical
%                   / Absolute Salinity in terms of P
% Tppc [O, K-1, N]: coefficients for piecewise polynomial for potential
%                   / Conservative Temperature in terms of P
% P [K, N]: knots for the pressure [dbar] or depth [m] of the casts
% BotK [1, N]: number of valid data points on each cast
% s [1, N]: initial practical / Absolute salinity on the initial surface
% t [1, N]: initial potential / Conservative temperature on the initial surface
% p [1, N]: initial pressure [dbar] or depth [m] of the surface at each cast
% dfnb [1,B]  : break points for the spline giving delta as a function of p
% dfnc [B-1,D+1]: coefficient matrix for the spline giving delta as a function of p
% s0 [1, 1]: reference S value for delta
% t0 [1, 1]: reference T value for delta
% tolp [1, 1]: tolerance on pressure [dbar] or depth [m] for vertical solver
%
% Note: O is the order of the piecewise polynomials down each cast
%       K is the maximum number of knots in these piecewise polynomials,
%           i.e. the maximum number of bottles in any cast
%       N is the number of water columns (possibly including land).
%       B is the number of break points in the spline.
%       D is the degree of the spline.
%
% Note: variables can actually be higher dimensional, e.g. N = [ni, nj],
%       and p can be any dimensional matrix, so long as it has N elements
%       in total.
%
% Note: P must increase along its first dimension.
%
%
% --- Output:
% p [same as input p]: pressure or depth of the updated surface
% s [same as input p]: practical / Absolute salinity of the updated surface
% t [same as input p]: potential / Conservative temperature of the updated surface%
