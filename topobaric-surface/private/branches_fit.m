%BRANCHES_FIT  Fit y as a multi-valued linear function of x subject to graph constraints.
%
%
% yfnx = branches_fit(x, y, arc_from, arc_to, arc_segment, node_fn, cb_arcs, cb_nodes)
% fits a multivalued function yfnx, each branch i of which is an affine
% linear function that best (in a least-squares sense) fits the data y(seg)
% to x(seg), where seg = arc_segment{i} indexes all data points associated
% with the arc i in the graph. The graph has an arc i incident to two
% nodes, arc_from(i) and arc_to(i); node n is associated with a value
% node_fn(n). A cycle basis for the graph is detailed by cb_arcs and
% cb_nodes. The branches of yfnx are fit subject to a set of constraints,
% one for each cycle in the cycle basis, such that the integral of yfnx (as
% can be computed from int_graph_fun) going around each cycle is zero.
%
% yfnx = branches_fit(x, y, arc_from, arc_to, arc_segment, node_fn, cb_arcs, cb_nodes, true)
% adds a second set of constraints such that the second integral of yfnx
% (as can be computed by applying int_graph_fun to the output of
% int_graph_fun called on yfnx) going around a cycle is zero.
%
%
% --- Input:
% x [1, D]: independent variable (must be row vector)
% y [1, D]: dependent variable (must be row vector)
% arc_from [A, 1]: the "lower" node that each arc is incident to
% arc_to   [A, 1]: the "higher" node that each arc is incident to
% arc_segment {A,1}: element a provides the indices, in the simplical
%   mesh, to the vertices in the associated region for arc a
% node_fn  [N, 1]: the value associated with each node
% cb_arcs {C,1}, cb_arcs{c} is arcs in cycle c of the cycle basis
% cb_nodes {C,1}, cb_nodes{c} is the nodes in cycle c of the cycle basis
% GEOSTRF [1, 1]: true if the second integral should also be constrained to
%   integrate to zero around each cycle.
%
%
% --- Output:
% yfnx [4, A]: the multivalued function. Each column defines a
%   single-valued branch as an affine linear function that may be evaluated
%   by pvaln
%
% Note, above A is the number of arcs, N the number of nodes, and C the
% number of cycles in the cycle basis of the graph. D the number of data
% points in the simplical mesh that arc_segment indexes.
