function path = path_from_pred(pred,d,t)
%PATH_FROM_PRED  Convert a predecessor array into a path to a vertex.
%
%
% path = path_from_pred(pred,d,t) 
% returns the list of nodes on a walk from a source node to a target node
% t. The predecessor array pred is a row vector such that
%   pred(i) = 0 if node i is the source node,
%   pred(i) = 0 if node i has no predecessor associated with it, or
%   pred(i) = j where node j preceeds node i on the shortest path from the
%               source node to i.
% The discovery time d is a vector such that
%   d(i) = -1 where node i is unreachable from the source node; otherwise,
%   d(i) = the number of nodes between the source node and node i.
% The target node, t, is an integer from 1 to n, where n is the length of
% the predecessor array.
% path(i) is the i'th node in the walk from the source node to node t.
% Typically, pred and d are output from a breadth-first search such as bfs
% in the GAIMC toolbox.
% 
% In the case that the node is the source or unreachable from the source,
% then path is a scalar, the source node. These input cases must be handled
% with care, for the output of path_from_pred in these cases are
% indistinguishable.
%
%
% --- Input:
% pred [1, N]: predecessor array
% d [1, N]: discovery time
% t [1, 1]: target node
% 
%
% --- Output:
% path [*, 1]: list of nodes in the walk from source node to target node.
