% phi = omega_matsolve_poisson(s, t, p, DIST2on1_iJ, DIST1on2_Ij, WRAP, A4, qu, N, m_ref)
% builds and solves the sparse matrix problem for omega surfaces in Poisson
% form. 
%
%
% --- Input:
%  s [ni, nj]: practical / Absolute Salinity on the surface
%  t [ni, nj]: potential / Conservative Temperature on the surface
%  p [ni, nj]: pressure (or depth) on the surface
% DIST2on1_iJ [ni, nj]: The grid distance in the second dimension divided
%   by the grid distance in the first dimension, both centred at (I-1/2,J).
%   Equivalently, the area of a grid cell centred at (I-1/2,J) divided by
%   the distance (in the first dimension) from (I-1,J) to (I,J).   
% DIST1on2_Ij [ni, nj]: The grid distance in the first dimension divided by
%   the grid distance in the second dimension, both centred at (I-1/2,J).
%   Equivalently, the area of a grid cell centred at (I,J-1/2) divided by
%   the distance (in the second dimension) from (I,J-1) to (I,J).   
% WRAP [2 element array]: WRAP(i) is true iff the domain is periodic in the
%                         i'th lateral dimension.  
% A4 [4, ni*nj]: adjacency matrix  (see grid_adjacency.m)
% qu [ni*nj,1]: the nodes visited by the BFS's in order from 1 to N (see bfs_conncomp1.m)
% N [1,1]: the number of water columns in the region; 
%          also, the last valid index of qu, i.e. the queue tail (see bfs_conncomp1.m)
% Iref [1,1]  : linear index to a reference cast at which phi will be zero.
%
%
% --- Output:
% phi [ni, nj]: density perturbation satisfying the discrete version of
%               div grad phi = - div epsilon,
%               where epsilon is the neutrality error (see ntp_errors.m).

% imply N == 1.  If N > 0 weren't guaranteed, this could throw an error.
