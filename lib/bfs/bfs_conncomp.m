%BFS_CONNCOMP  Find connected components using Breadth First Search
%
%
% [qu, qts, ncc] = bfs_conncomp(G, A, r)
% performs a breadth first search (BFS) through nodes of a graph, starting
% from the root node r.  The graph is best thought of as laid out on a
% grid, with nodes at the true locations of the multi-dimensional array G,
% and numbered by their linear index in G.   Node m is adjacent to node n =
% A(m,j) provided (n <= numel(G) && G(n)), for each j = 1 : D, where D =
% size(A,2) is the maximal degree in the graph. The outputs are: the search
% queue for the BFS, qu; the tail indices of qu for the BFS, qts; and the
% number of connected components found, ncc = 1. Specifically, qu(qts(1) :
% qts(2)-1) are the linear indices to true locations of G searched by the
% BFS.  Note, qu(1) = r, and qts(1) = 1.
%
% [qu, qts, ncc] = bfs_conncomp(G, A)
% as above, but scans the nodes from first to last, starting a separate BFS
% on any node previously undiscovered by a BFS.  Each BFS discovers an
% entire connected component. The outputs are: the combined search queue
% for all the BFS, qu: the tail indices of qu for each BFS, qts; and the
% number of connected components, ncc.  Specifically,  qu(qts(i) :
% qts(i+1)-1) are linear indices to the i'th connected component of G,
% ordered by their discovery time in the i'th BFS, for i = 1 : ncc.  Note,
% qts(1) = 1.
%
% [...] = bfs_conncomp(..., qu)
% works on qu using memory in-place, where the fourth argument qu is a
% vector of length N and class double.  Pass r as [] to use this with the
% second form above.
%
% [qu, qts, ncc, G] = bfs_conncomp(...)
% also returns a modified G that is true only where the BFS has walked.
% When r is not provided, the output G should match the input G.
%
% [qu, qts, ncc, G, L] = bfs_conncomp(...)
% also returns a label array L, the same size as G. Specifically, L(n) = i
% for all n in the i'th connected component, for i = 1 : ncc; otherwise
% L(n) = 0.
%
%
% --- Input:
% G [array with N elements]: true where there are nodes, false elsewhere
% A [D,N]: adjacency, where D is the most neighbours possible
% r [1,1]: perform one BFS from this root node (optional)
% qu [N,1]: vector to work in-place (optional)
%
%
% --- Output:
% qu [N,1]: the nodes visited by the BFS's in order from 1 to qts(end)
% qts [ncc+1,1]: the queue tail indices for each connected component
% ncc [1,1]: the number of connected components of G
% G [array with N elements]: true where there are nodes that have been discovered
% L [array with N elements]: label array
