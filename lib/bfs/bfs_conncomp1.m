function [qu, qt] = bfs_conncomp1(G, A, r, qu) %#codegen
%BFS_CONNCOMP1  Find one connected component using Breadth First Search
%
%
% [qu, qt] = bfs_conncomp(G, A, r)
% performs a breadth first search (BFS) through nodes of a graph, starting
% from the root node r.  The graph is best thought of as laid out on a
% grid, with nodes at the true locations of the multi-dimensional array G,
% and numbered by their linear index in G.   Node m is adjacent to node n =
% A(m,j) provided (n <= numel(G) && G(n)), for each j = 1 : D, where D =
% size(A,2) is the maximal degree in the graph. The outputs are: the search
% queue for the BFS, qu; the tail index of qu for the BFS, qt.
% Specifically, qu(1 : qt) are the linear indices to true locations of G
% searched by the BFS.
%
% [...] = bfs_conncomp(..., qu)
% works on qu using memory in-place, where the fourth argument qu is a
% vector of length N and class double.
%
%
% --- Input:
% G [array with N elements]: true where there are nodes, false elsewhere
% A [D,N]: adjacency, where D is the most neighbours possible
% r [1,1]: perform one BFS from this root node
% qu [N,1]: vector to work in-place (optional)
%
%
% --- Output:
% qu [N,1]: the nodes visited by the BFS's in order from 1 to qt
% qt [1,1]: the queue tail index
