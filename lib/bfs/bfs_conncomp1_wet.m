function [s, t, p, freshly_wet, qu, qt] = bfs_conncomp1_wet(Sppc, Tppc, P, s, t, p, ML, TOL_P, A, BotK, r, qu) %#codegen
%BFS_CONNCOMP1_WET  Find one connected component using Breadth First Search,
%                   and test neutral tangent plane connections from the perimeter
%
%
% [s, t, p, freshly_wet] = bfs_conncomp1_wet(Sppc, Tppc, P, s, t, p, ML, TOL_P, A, BotK, r, qu)
% works as bfs_conncomp1.m, with G in that function given by isfinite(p).
% That is, nodes in the surface are walked from the root node r.  Where an
% invalid node is reached which is not part of the surface but nonetheless
% ocean (BotK > 1 here), a neutral tangent plane calculation is performed
% from the surface to the cast at this node.  If successful, and if the NTP
% link reaches this neighbouring cast below the mixed layer, then this node
% is added to the surface, the salinity and temperature are interpolated
% using the piecewise polynomials Sppc and Tppc with knots at P, and the
% BFS continues.  NTP connections are accurate to a pressure or depth of
% TOL_P. The input qu is optional, simply to save memory by working
% in-place.  On output, qu(1:qt) are linear indices to the nodes on the
% surface (whether or not they are freshly wet), in the order that they
% were added to the queue.  Note qu(1) == r.
%
%
% --- Input:
% Sppc [O,K-1,ni,nj]: coefficients for piecewise polynomial for practical
%                   / Absolute Salinity in terms of P
% Tppc [O,K-1,ni,nj]: coefficients for piecewise polynomial for potential
%                   / Conservative Temperature in terms of P
% P [K,ni,nj]: knots for the pressure or depth of the casts
% s [ni,nj]: practical / Absolute salinity on the surface
% t [ni,nj]: potential / Conservative temperature on the surface
% p [ni,nj]: pressure or depth on the surface
% ML [ni,nj]: pressure or depth of the mixed layer.
% TOL_P [1,1]: tolerance in p for finding neutral connections
% A [D, ni*nj]: adjacency, where D is the most neighbours possible
% qu [N,1]: vector to work in-place (optional)
% BotK [ni,nj]: number of valid data points on each cast
% r [1, 1]: linear index to the reference cast
% qu [N,1]: vector to work in-place (optional)
%
%
% --- Output:
% s [ni,nj]: updated practical/Absolute salinity on the surface
% t [ni,nj]: updated potential/Conservative temperature on the surface
% p [ni,nj]: updated pressure [dbar] or depth [m] of the surface
% freshly_wet [1,1]: number of casts freshly wet
% qu [N,1]: the nodes visited by the BFS's in order from 1 to qt
% qt [1,1]: the queue tail index
