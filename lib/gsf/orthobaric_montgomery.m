function gsf = orthobaric_montgomery(s, t, p, P, A, Y, s0, t0, WRAP, OPTS, varargin)
%ORTHOBARIC_MONTGOMERY  The Montgomery potential with a functional offset.
%
% Zhang and Hogg (1992) upgraded the Montgomery (1937) potential by
% subtracting a constant reference pressure, to minimize errors when the
% surface in question is not a specific volume anomaly surface, on which
% the Montgomery potential is exact. Stanley (2018) extends this further,
% subtracting a reference pressure that is a function of specific volume
% anomaly.
%
%
% gsf = orthobaric_montgomery(s, t, p, P, A, Y, s0, t0, OPTS)
% computes the orthobaric Montgomery potential gsf on a surface with
% practical / Absolute salinity, potential / Conservative temperature, and
% pressure given by s, t, and p respectively, and with s and t reference
% values given by s0 and t0, respectively, in an ocean with pressure P,
% specific volume A, and hydrostatic acceleration potential Y, and with
% equation of state for the specific volume given by eos.m in the path. The
% specific volume should be calculated by A = eos(S, T, P) where S is the
% practical / Absolute salinity and T is the potential / Conservative
% temperature at the data sites of P. The hydrostatic acceleration
% potential should be calculated as Y = hsap3(P, ATMP, ETAN, A, grav),
% where ATMP is the atmospheric pressure, ETAN is the sea-surface height,
% and grav the gravitational acceleration. If s0 or t0 are empty, they are
% both taken as the values of s and t, respectively, where p is a maximum;
% this is done separately for each connected region of the surface. Inputs
% s and t may instead be S and T, in which case s and t is determined by
% linear interpolation of S and T through P onto p. Algorithmic parameters
% are determined by OPTS. On each connected region of the surface, the
% pressure is fit as a spline function of the specific volume anomaly (the
% specific volume minus that using the reference values s0 and t0) of order
% OPTS.SPLINE_ORDER and having at most OPTS.SPLINE_PIECES number of pieces.
% To determine the connected regions, the surface is treated as periodic in
% its first dimension (longitude) if WRAP(1) is true, and likewise
% treated periodic in its second dimension (latitude) if WRAP(2) is
% true.
%
% gsf = orthobaric_montgomery(s, t, z, Z, R, Y, s0, t0, OPTS, grav, rho_c)
% computes the orthobaric Montgomery potential gsf on a surface with
% practical / Absolute salinity, potential / Conservative temperature, and
% depth given by s, t, and z respectively, and with s and t reference
% values given by s0 and t0, respectively, in a Boussinesq ocean with
% in-situ density R and hydrostatic acceleration potential Y given at
% depths Z, with gravitational acceleration grav and Boussinesq reference
% density rho_c, and with equation of state for the in-situ density given
% by eos.m in the path. The in-situ density should be calculated by R =
% eos(S, T, Z) where S is the practical / Absolute salinity and T is the
% potential / Conservative temperature at the depths Z. The hydrostatic
% acceleration potential should be calculated as Y = hsap3(Z, ATMP, ETAN,
% R, grav, rho_c), where ATMP is the atmospheric pressure and ETAN is the
% sea-surface height. If s0 or t0 are empty, they are both taken as the
% values of s and t, respectively, where z is a maximum; this is done
% separately for each connected region of the surface. Inputs s and t may
% instead be S and T, in which case s and t is determined by linear
% interpolation of S and T through Z onto z. Algorithmic parameters are
% determined by OPTS. On each connected region of the surface, the depth is
% fit as a spline function of the in-situ density anomaly (the in-situ
% density minus that using the reference values s0 and t0) of order
% OPTS.SPLINE_ORDER and having at most OPTS.SPLINE_PIECES number of pieces.
% To determine the connected regions, the surface is treated as periodic in
% its first dimension (longitude) if WRAP(1) is true, and likewise
% treated periodic in its second dimension (latitude) if WRAP(2) is
% true. Note z and Z must be positive and increase downwards.
