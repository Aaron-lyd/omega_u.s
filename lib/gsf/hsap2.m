function [y,m] = hsap2(s, t, p, varargin)
%HSAP2  Integrate hydrostatic balance to obtain acceleration potential on a surface.
%
%
% y = hsap2(s, t, p)
% with s and t scalars, computes
% 1e4 * \int_0^p eos(s,t,p') dp'
% using trapezoidal integration with uniform interval of 0.1 dbar, where
% eos is a function in the path giving the specific volume.
%
% y = hsap2(s, t, p, p0, P)
% computes
% 1e4 * \int_p0^p eos(s,t,p') dp'
% using trapezoidal integration on the intervals given by columns of P,
% where eos is a function in the path giving the specific volume. If s and
% t have an extra (vertical) dimension relative to p, they are interpolated
% onto the surface.
%
% y = hsap2(s, t, p, P, A, Y)
% computes
% grav * ETAN  +  1e4 * \int_ATMP^p A dp'
% using trapezoidal integration on the intervals given by columns of P.
% Here, grav is the gravitational acceleration, ETAN is the sea-surface
% height, and ATMP is the atmospheric pressure at the sea-surface, and A is
% the specific volume at the data sites of the pressure P. These are
% encapsulated in the acceleration potential from hydrostatic balance at
% the data sites of A and P, given by Y = hsap3(P, ATMP, ETAN, A, grav).
% The practical / Absolute salinity and the potential / Conservative
% temperature on the surface whose pressure is p are given by s and t,
% respectively; these are used to compute the specific volume on the
% surface itself a = eos(s, t, p), which is used in the final term in the
% summation that trapezoidally integrates between the surface itself and
% the data site just shallower than the surface. If s and t have 2 more
% dimensions than p, they are interpreted as cofficients of piecewise
% polynomials for the 3D S and T as functions of P in each water column,
% and they are evaluated onto the surface.
%
% [y, a] = hsap2(...)
% also returns a = eos(s, t, p), the specific volume on the surface.
%
%
% For a Boussinesq ocean, instead use the following forms. Note that z > 0
% and Z > 0 and these increase downwards.
%
% y = hsap2(s, t, z, grav, rho_c)
% with s and t scalars, computes
% (grav / rho_c) * \int_z0^z eos(s, t, z') dz'
% using trapezoidal integration with uniform interval of 0.1 m, where eos
% is a function in the path that gives the in-situ density.
%
% y = hsap2(s, t, z, z0, Z, grav, rho_c)
% computes
% (grav / rho_c) * \int_z0^z eos(s, t, z') dz'
% using trapezoidal integration on the intervals given by column(s) of Z,
% where eos is a function in the path giving the in-situ density. If s and
% t are the same size as R and Y, they are interpolated onto the surface.
%
% y = hsap2(s, t, z, Z, R, Y, grav, rho_c)
% computes
% (1e-4 / rho_c) * ATMP + grav * ETAN + (grav / rho_c) * \int_0^z R dz'
% using trapezoidal integration on the intervals given by columns of Z.
% Here, grav is the gravitational acceleration, ETAN is the sea-surface
% height, and ATMP is the atmospheric pressure at the sea-surface, and R is
% the in-situ density at the depths Z. These are encapsulated in the
% acceleration potential from hydrostatic balance at the data sites of R,
% given by Y = hsap3(Z, ATMP, ETAN, R, grav, rho_c). The practical /
% Absolute salinity and the potential / Conservative temperature on the
% surface whose depth is z are given by s and t, respectively; these are
% used to compute the in-situ density on the surface itself r = eos(s, t,
% z), which is used in the final term in the summation that trapezoidally
% integrates between the surface itself and the data site just shallower
% than the surface. If s and t have 2 more dimensions than p, they are
% interpreted as cofficients of piecewise polynomials for the 3D S and T as
% functions of P in each water column, and they are evaluated onto the
% surface.
%
% [y, r] = hsap2(..., grav, rho_c)
% also returns r = eos(s, t, z), the in-situ density
% on the surface.

%
% --- Input:
% s [1, 1] or [ni, nj] or [O, nk-1, ni, nj]: the practical / Absolute
%   salinity, as a reference value, the values on the surface, or a
%   piecewise polynomial interpolant in each water column
% t [1, 1] or [ni, nj] or [O, nk-1, ni, nj]: the potential / Conservative
%   temperature as a reference value, the values on the surface, or a
%   piecewise polynomial interpolant in each water column
% p [ni, nj]: pressure on surface [dbar]
% z [ni, nj]: depth on surface [m, positive]
% p0 [1, 1]: reference pressure [dbar]
% z0 [1, 1]: reference depth [m, positive]
% P [nk, ni, nj] or [nk, 1]: pressure [dbar]
% Z [nk, ni, nj] or [nk, 1]: depth [m, positive]
% A [nk, ni, nj]: specific volume [m^3 kg^-1]
% R [nk, ni, nj]: in-situ density [kg m^-3]
% Y [nk, ni, nj]: the acceleration potential from hydrostatic balance [m^2 s^-2]
% grav [1, 1]: the gravitational acceleration [m s^-2]
% rho_c [1, 1]: the Boussinesq reference density [kg m^-3]
%
% Note: nk is the maximum number of data points per water column,
%       ni is the number of data points in longitude,
%       nj is the number of data points in latitude.
%
% Note: physical units for s and t are determined by eos.m.
%
% Note: the Montgomery (1937) potential, and its upgraded forms owing to
% Zhang and Hogg (1992) and to McDougall and Klocker (2010), as well as the
% orthobaric Montgomery potential (Stanley 2019) all use s0 and t0 as
% constant scalar values. The Cunningham (2000) geostrophic stream function
% uses s0 and t0 as the S and T values on the surface.
%
%
% --- Output:
% y [ni, nj]: acceleration potential from hydrostatic balance [m^2 s^-2]
% a [ni, nj]: specific volume on the surface [m^3 kg^-1]
% r [ni, nj]: in-situ density on the surface [kg m^-3]
