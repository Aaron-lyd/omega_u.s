function d1 = veronis_density(p_ref, S, T, P, p0, p1, dp, interpfn)
% VERONIS_DENSITY  The surface density plus the integrated vertical 
%                  gradient of Locally Referenced Potential Density.
%
%
% d1 = veronis_density(p_ref, S, T, P, p0, p1)
% determines the Veronis density d1 at vertical position p1 on a cast with
% practical / Absolute salinity S and potential / Conservative temperature
% T values at depth or pressure values P.  The Veronis density is given by
% the potential density (with reference pressure / depth p_ref) evaluated
% at p0 on the cast, plus the integral of the vertical (d/dX) derivative of
% Locally Referenced Potential Density (LRPD) from P = p0 to P = p1. The
% vertical (d/dP) derivative of LRPD is rho_S dS/dP + rho_T dT/dP where
% rho_S and rho_T are the partial derivatives of density with respect to S
% and T, and dS/dP and dT/dP are the derivatives of S and T with respect to
% P.  The equation of state for density is given by eos.m in the PATH, and
% its partial derivatives with respect to S and T are given by eos_s_t.m in
% the PATH.  If p0 or p1 are outside the range of P, d1 is returned as NaN.
% 
% d1 = veronis_density(..., dp)
% specifies the maximum interval size used in the trapezoidal numerical
% integration.  If omitted, the default size is 1 unit of P (1m or 1 dbar).

% d1 = veronis_density(..., interpfn)
% uses interpfn (a function handle) to interpolate S and T as piecewise polynomials of P.
% If interpfn = @ppc_linterp, the result is the same as if interpfn were omitted
% and linear interpolation were performed native to this code.  Other functions
% from the PPC toolbox can be used, e.g. ppc_pchip and ppc_makima.
%
% Provide [] for any optional arguments that are required only to provide 
% a value for an argument later in the list. 
%
%
% --- Input:
% p_ref [1,1]: reference pressure / depth to evaluate potential density at p0
% S [nk, nt] : practical / Absolute Salinity values on a cast
% T [nk, nt] : potential / Conservative Temperature values on a cast
% P [nk, nt] : pressure / depth values on a cast
% p0 [1, 1]  : pressure / depth that starts the integral
% p1 [1, 1]  : pressure / depth that ends the integral
% dp [1, 1]  : maximum interval of pressure / depth in numerical integration
% interpfn [function handle]: function to calcualte piecewise polynomial coefficients
%
%
% --- Output:
%  d1 [1, 1]: Veronis density
%
%
% --- Discussion:
% The result of this function can serve as a density label for an
% approximately neutral surface. However, this is NOT the same as a value
% of the Jackett and McDougall (1997) Neutral Density variable. This is
% true even if you were to provide this function with the same cast that
% Jackett and McDougall (1997) used to initially label their Neutral
% Density variable, namely the cast at 188 deg E, 4 deg S, from the Levitus
% (1982) ocean atlas. Some difference would remain, because of differences
% in numerics, and because of a subsequent smoothing step in the Jackett
% and McDougall (1997) algorithm. This function merely allows one to label
% an approximately neutral surface with a density value that is INTERNALLY
% consistent within the dataset where one's surface lives. This function is
% NOT to compare density values against those from any other dataset, such
% as 1997 Neutral Density.
