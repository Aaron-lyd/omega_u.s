function [y,z] = ppc_val2(X, C, D, x, d) %#codegen
%PPC_VAL2  Piecewise Polynomial Evaluation, quick and twice
%
%
% [y,z] = ppc_val2(X, C, D, x)
% evaluates the piecewise polynomials whose coefficients are C and D and
% whose knots are X, at data sites x.
%
% [y,z] = ppc_val2(..., d)
% as above but evaluates the d'th derivative.
%
%
% --- Input:
% X [    K   x M], knots of the piecewise polynomials
% C [O x K-1 x N], coefficients of the first piecewise polynomial
% D [O x K-1 x N], coefficients of the second piecewise polynomial
% x [    L   x M], evaluation sites
% d [1, 1]       , order of derivative to evaluate; defaults to 0 if not
%                  given, which means to evaluate with no differentiation.
%
%
% --- Output:
% y [L x N], the first piecewise polynomial evaluated at x
% z [L x N], the second piecewise polynomial evaluated at x
%
%
% --- Notes:
% X(:,n) must be monotonically increasing for all n.
%
% NaN's in X are treated as +Inf (and as such must come at the end of each
% column).
%
% M, the last dimension of X and x, can be either 1 or N.
%
% Any dimension N can actually be higher-dimensional, so long as it has N
% elements.
%
% Even if L == 1, x does need a leading singleton dimension.
%
% If L == 1, this dimension is squeeze()'d out of y and z.
